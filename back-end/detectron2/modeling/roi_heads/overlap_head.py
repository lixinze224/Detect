Shape shorthand in this module:

    N: number of images in the minibatch
    R: number of ROIs, combined over all images, in the minibatch
    Ri: number of ROIs in image i
    K: number of foreground classes. E.g.,there are 80 foreground classes in COCO.

Naming convention:

    deltas: refers to the 4-d (dx, dy, dw, dh) deltas that parameterize the box2box
    transform (see :class:`box_regression.Box2BoxTransform`).

    pred_class_logits: predicted class scores in [-inf, +inf]; use
        softmax(pred_class_logits) to estimate P(class).

    gt_classes: ground-truth classification labels in [0, K], where [0, K) represent
        foreground object classes and K represents the background class.

    pred_proposal_deltas: predicted box2box transform deltas for transforming proposals
        to detection box predictions.

    gt_proposal_deltas: ground-truth box2box transform deltas
